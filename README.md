## An incredibly fast downloader for all HD wallpapers from MKBHD’s Panels app.

### How to use:
Ensure you have Node.js version **v20.17.0** or newer before running the script:

    node index.js
It’s that simple—no additional dependencies required!

### Just why?
MKBHD thought launching an app with the following was a good idea:

•  **Intrusive Tracking**: The app employed excessively invasive tracking measures, monitoring location and search history without justification.

•  **High Artist Commissions**: Artists faced a staggering 50% commission on sales, which is notably higher than Apple’s 30% fee for app purchases.

•  **Ad-Heavy Experience**: Users were required to watch two ads for each wallpaper download, which only provided access to standard definition images.

•  **Subscription Model**: Access to high-definition wallpapers was locked behind a $50 annual subscription fee.

•  **Unsecured access**: All wallpapers are accessible via a public URL, which enables this script to function and clarifies that this project is not “stealing.”
